           is a fintech company with a mission to provide clarity for 
          all of life’s financial decisions. A part of the product helps users 
          compare offers (ie. credit cards, mortgages, loans, etc.) to find the 
          best one for them. I worked specifically on the Mortgages Offer 
          Comparison experience; where users can filter down all possible 
          mortgages to just the ones that are relevant to them.
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
            A tool to help users compare mortgages and find the best one for them
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/mortgage-rates"
            class="highlight swipe-up"
            target="_blank"> The comparison tool </a>
            is a key driver of SEO. However, the 
            experience is outdated and therefore not fully meeting user needs. In 
            the original experience, users go through a series of questions (also 
            known as the pre-qual flow) about what they are looking for. Once 
            these questions are answered, users are then shown a list of the most 
            relevant offers. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Analytics show that there is a high abandonment rate (~67%) during the 
            pre-qual flow where users drop off before ever arriving at the final 
            page displaying the offers. Beyond that, there were also other various 
            opportunities to improve user experience. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, during my internship, there was also an ongoing 
            initiative: “transform with Currency''. Currency is NerdWallet’s 
            design system that had recently been overhauled to increase 
            accessibility and consistency. As a result, the typography, layout, 
            and some components of old designs needed to be updated, including 
            the mortgage comparison experience.             
        </p>
        <p>

        <p class="callout">
            How might we redesign the current mortgage comparison experience to 
            better meet user needs, reduce abandonment rate, and increase 
            click-through rates? 
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>The process that I followed was a highly collaborative one with 
            stakeholders involved every step of the way. I would share and get 
            feedback on my concepts and designs as early and frequently as 
            possible.

        <br>

        <h3>Arriving at the Solution</h3>
        <h2>Research Findings</h2>
        <p>
            The project kicked off with research, discovery, and competitive 
            analysis. To get a better understanding of where the opportunities 
            for improvement lied, we conducted stakeholder interviews and looked 
            at the existing, holistic mortgage shopping experience and past user 
            research decks. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-research.png" class="center-img" />
        <p class="caption">Left: Stakeholder interview notes. Right: User 
            research decks.</p>

        <p>For market research, we looked at similar experiences in both fintech 
            and ecommerce. While NerdWallet is a fintech company, a part of the 
            experience involves shopping for a mortgage, making ecommerce a viable 
            source of inspiration. </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-competitive-analysis.png" class="center-img" />
        <p class="caption">Competitive analysis</p>
        </p>
        <p>Finally, we synthesized all the information gathered and pulled out the 
            key findings to come up with a few concrete steps to move forward with. 
        </p>

        <p><b>Key findings:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The process of shopping for a home is a long one; users will come and 
            go on NerdWallet throughout their journey
          </li>
          <li>
            Mortgage shoppers are always doing research and wanting to learn more 
          </li>
          <li>
            The ability to personalize generates value 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Users want results to be tailored to their situation and they 
                    often have more than one possible scenario that they’d like to 
                    explore 
                </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Non-negotiable features that make for a good shopping experience are: 
            filter, sort, and narrow
          </li>
          <li>
            Similar experiences for other verticals on NerdWallet that show offers 
            immediately coming from Google’s search engine results page perform 
            exceptionally well
          </li>
          <li>
            It’s important to consider business and SEO needs
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br> 

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
            Three major areas of improvement were made, along with updating the 
            designs per Currency guidelines:  
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
            Improved filtering capabilities, helping users navigate long form
            content, and improving the "beat my offer" feature
        </p>
        
        <br />

        <h3>Improvement Breakdown & Decisions</h3>
        <h2>Improved Filtering</h2>
        <h5>Original Experience</h5>
        <p>
            When users google “mortgage rates”, they arrive at the landing page 
            for the compare mortgage rates experience from Google’s search engine 
            results page (SERP). Alternatively, they can get there from NerdWallet 
            global navigation. There they can find the entry point to the pre-qual 
            flow where they will be asked a series of questions regarding what 
            they’re looking for. Users only have to go through the pre-qual flow 
            once as their inputs are saved via cookies. Upon completion, users are 
            shown a list of relevant mortgages along with filters that can be used 
            to refine their results. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-original-flow.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Original user flow</p>
        <br> 

        <h5>Redesigned Experience</h5>
        <h4>
          Design Decision:
          <span class="highlight">Remove Redundancy</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
            The filters on the results page adjust the exact same criteria as the 
            questions asked in the pre-qual flow, making the pre-qual flow 
            redundant. Given that there is a 67% abandonment rate that occurs 
            during the pre-qual flow, we decided to remove the flow altogether and 
            combine the contents of the mortgage comparison landing page (where 
            the pre-qual entry point lived) with the final page displaying the 
            offers. That way, users can immediately see mortgages as soon as they 
            arrive.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-new-flow.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">New, improved user flow</p>
        <br>

        <h4>
            Design Decision: 
            <span class="highlight">Easy to Access</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
            Given that the pre-qual flow was removed, we wanted to ensure that: 
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Users don’t miss the filters</li>
                <li>Filters can be easily accessed </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>User research shows that users shopping for mortgages will use the 
            filters frequently to “scenario plan”. Those filters are being used 
            as a tool to shop for the best mortgage in any given, plausible 
            situation. 
        </p>
        <p>
            On mobile, filters were made to be more prominent and to keep users 
            informed of their search criteria. Compared to the original design 
            where the access point to filters was small and easy to miss, the 
            redesign leverages the card component to increase visibility and 
            touch target. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-filter-entry.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Left: Old filter entry point. Right: New filter 
            Entry Point.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other general usability improvements were also made to filter on 
            mobile. Input groups were more distinctly separated to improve 
            accessibility and scannability while helping users find a specific 
            input quicker. The filter drawer was reduced from full screen to 
            two-third screen so that interactive content is within thumb’s reach 
            (content is within the thumb zone).  
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-filter-sheet.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Left: Original filter sheet. Middle: New filter sheet.
            Right: New filter sheet within context of the thumb zone.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            On desktop and mobile, the filters will appear if the user scrolls 
            up within the results table. In the original experience, users would 
            have to scroll all the way back to the top of the table if they wanted 
            to access the filters. With this redesign interaction, users can easily 
            access the filters without it being too intrusive and taking screen 
            real estate away from browsing through offers.

        <p>
          This is especially useful on mobile where scrolling all the way back to 
          the top of the offer table can be tedious if there are many offers.

          <h4>
            Design Decision: 
            <span class="highlight">Feedback</span>
        </h4>
        <p>A previously identified usability issue on desktop was that users 
            weren’t sure if changing the inputs would change the offers displayed 
            to them. To address that problem, a clear CTA to refresh the offers 
            was added. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-cta.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Left: Original inputs. Right: Redesigned inputs with 
            a clear CTA.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, a brief loading screen is shown upon refresh (even 
        if the offers have already been loaded) to reassure the user that offers 
        are being selected based on their inputs. 
        </p>

        <p class="caption">Skeleton load</p>

        <h5>Past Iterations</h5>
        <p>A side rail filter on desktop was explored in early stages of the 
            process. Market research in not just the fintech space but also the 
            ecommerce space show filters in a side rail to be a popular pattern 
            due to its ease of access. </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-side-filter.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Side rail filter exploration</p>
        <p>However, upon discussion with cross-functional partners and 
            stakeholders, we realized that it’s not a feasible concept for a 
            number of reasons: 
            <ol>
                <li>NerdWallet’s design system team informed us that it’s not as 
                    accessible compared to having the filters at the top 
                </li>
                <li>Engineering noted that it may not be the most responsive 
                    solution (when paired with the table of content feature) and 
                    the desired interaction may be tricky and beyond scope
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <br> 

        <h2>Table of Content</h2>
        <h5>Original Experience</h5>
        <p>NerdWallet pages tend to be very long and content rich. For the 
            mortgage comparison experience, there’s a wealth of valuable and 
            educational information below the offers table. User research shows 
            that users typically don’t scroll down far enough to read information 
            below the table on result pages, but that doesn’t mean that the 
            information isn’t useful.
        </p>

        <h5>Redesigned Experience</h5>
        <p>To help users better navigate long form content and find useful 
            information that will help them make the best financial decision for 
            them, a table of content component was introduced. </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-toc.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Left: Table of content on mobile. Right: Table of 
            content on desktop.

        <h4>
            Design Decision: 
            <span class="highlight">Page Overview & Landmark</span>
        </h4>
        <p>One benefit of the table of content is that it gives users a high level 
            overview of the page’s content. This will surface potentially useful 
            information to the user that they may have otherwise missed if they 
            didn’t know to scroll further down the page. It also helps users keep 
            track of where they are on the page.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-toc-desktop.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Active table of content on desktop</p>
        <p>On mobile, the table of content is partially collapsed by default so that 
            part of the page content is still visible within the viewport without 
            making the table of content too unnoticeable.

        <h4>
            Design Decision: 
            <span class="highlight">Page Navigation</span>
        </h4>
        <p>The table of content can also be used for on page navigation. For users 
            who are looking for something in particular, they can use it to jump 
            directly to a specific section. Users can easily get their questions 
            answered by the information below the offer table and return to browsing 
            through mortgages seamlessly. </p>

            Design Decision: 
            <span class="highlight">Always Accessible</span>
        </h4>
        <p>On desktop, the table of content is always present in the right rail so 
            that users can access and use it at any time.

        <p>While the table of content scrolls away on mobile (it would take up too 
            much space otherwise), a “back to top” button appears when the user 
            starts scrolling up anywhere within the page. That way, they can quickly 
            and easily get back to the table of content.

        <h5>Past Iterations</h5>
        <p>Early table of content explorations included horizontal tabs rather than 
            vertical ones. However, this option was quickly ruled out due to its 
            similarity to an existing component. 
        </p>

        <h2>Beat My Offer (BMX)</h2>
        <h5>Original Experience</h5>
        <p>Within the pre-qual flow, users have the option to enter the details of 
            an existing offer if they have one. Then, on the results page with all 
            the offers, the offers are compared against the one that they currently 
            have. Users will be shown all relevant offers and how much they either 
            save or lose compared to their current quote. The entry point to the 
            beat my offer (BMX) feature was disguised as a question and easy to miss. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-bmx-original.png" width="100%">
        <p class="caption">Original BMX entry point</p>
        <p>Furthermore, once on the results page, BMX cannot be accessed again since 
            the answers inputted from the pre-qual flow are saved in cookies. Users 
            cannot go back into the pre-qual flow once complete unless they clear 
            their cookies. 
        </p>
        <h5>Redesigned Experience</h5>
        <p>The BMX entry point was moved to the results page so that it’s always 
            accessible and visible. User research shows that the mortgage shopping 
            and home buying process is a long one so users return to NerdWallet 
            throughout their journey. It’s likely that they may come back at a later 
            time with an offer but are not able to access the BMX feature. By moving 
            the entry point to always be present, users can then access it whenever 
            they need to. 
        </p>

        <h4>
            Design Decision: 
            <span class="highlight">Large Touch Target</span>
        </h4>
        <p>Using a card rather than just a button to contain the entry point increases 
            the touch target so that users don’t miss it. User feedback showed that 
            this feature is well liked so we want to make it easy to find. 
            Additionally, a CTA to add a quote was included to increase affordances. 
        </p>

        <h4>
            Design Decision: 
            <span class="highlight">Moment of Delight</span>
        </h4>
        <p>The home buying process can be a tedious and stressful one so we wanted to 
            ncorporate as many moments of delight as possible. If there are offers 
            better than the one that the user currently has, we want to celebrate that! 
            We worked with the brand studio team to create a short celebratory animation 
            that rains confetti and money. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-bmx-confetti.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Moment of delight: celebratory moment</p>
        <p>Accompanying the animation is a snackbar informing the user just how much 
            money they can save. 
        </p>
        <h4>
            Design Decision: 
            <span class="highlight">Keep Users Informed</span>
        </h4>
        <p>Keeping accessibility in mind, information regarding how much money the user 
            can save is displayed within the BMX card even after the animation and 
            snackbar has faded away along with the inputted quote to keep the user 
            informed. 
        </p>

        <p class="caption">Informative and accessible filled BMX card</p>
        <br>
        <h5>Past Iterations</h5>
        <p>We explored two card concepts for the BMX entry point on mWeb. Concept A has 
            a clearer CTA but concept B takes up less vertical screen real estate. 
            Ultimately, we opted for concept B to get users to the offers quicker. 
            Additionally, by going with the shorter card, more of the results table will 
            be visible within the viewport. Additionally, with concept A, there may be 
            too many conflicting CTAs. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-bmx-cards.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Left: Concept A. Right: Concept B.</p>
        <p>In the first iteration of the moment of delight, the celebratory moment was 
            displayed in a modal. During a design review, another designer raised the 
            concern that the modal may be intrusive and inaccessible. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-bmx-modal.png" width="100%">
        <p class="caption">First iteration of BMX's celebratory moment</p>
        <p>Jamming with another designer, we explored various other concepts before I 
            finally arrived at design. The iterations leading up to the final design 
            were either too intrusive or not delightful enough. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-bmx-explorations.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">BMX celebratory  moment explorations</p>
        <p>The final animation paired along with the snackbar and note within the card 
            strikes the right balance between delightful, non-intrusive, and accessible. 
        </p>

        <h3>Other Concept Explorations</h3>
        <h2>Saving Offers</h2>
        <p>User research shows that users aren’t always ready to commit to an offer and 
            will return at a later time. To encourage users to come back to NerdWallet, 
            being able to save offers will make it easier for them to find what they were 
            previously looking at. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/nw-saving.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Saving specific offers exploration (mobile & desktop)</p>
        <p>However, this introduced a lot of engineering complexity (ie. Where would offers 
            be saved to? Do users have to be logged into a NerdWallet account? Cookies? 
            etc.) so we did not move forward with it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2>Flagging, Narrowing, and Organizing</h2>
        <p>Given that users are thinking of multiple scenarios, the concept of flagging 
            offers can help users narrow down from many offers to a few. To take it one step 
            further, users could even mark each offer with a different colour/tag to keep 
            track of their decision making process. 
        </p>

        <p class="caption">Flagging and labelling offers exploration (mobile & desktop)</p>
        <p>While the PM liked the idea, he was cautious of introducing a whole new feature 
            during a redesign. Additionally, a feature like this would be out of scope for 
            this project. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <h2>Impact</h2>
        <p>The research done around improving the mortgage comparison experience 
            was transferable to other similar experiences in different verticals (ie. 
            personal loans, credit cards, banking, etc). The emphasis placed on improving 
            filter capabilities in this experience inspired the work on another team that 
            was formed to redesign filters on NerdWallet. My PM liked some of the concepts 
            so much that he brought them to the rest of the Product team to see how they 
            can be incorporated into other parts of the product.
        </p>
        <p>Additionally, the table of content component led to the second project of my 
            internship that ultimately resulted in the creation and proposal of a new 
            component to be introduced into Currency (NerdWallet’s design system). Want to 
            learn more about it? Stay tuned for a separate case study!

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <h4>Confidence & ownership</h4>
        <p>Through this internship, I realized how important it was to have the 
            confidence to truly advocate for users. It’s scary to own an entire project 
            and be the one at the table to speak up but over the course of the summer, 
            I gained the confidence to defend my decisions. I learned how to think deeply 
            about what we were doing and respectfully pushback or question decisions, 
            using research and data to empower my rationale. This was the first time I 
            truly felt the weight of the responsibility that designers have to our users 
            and what it means to advocate for them. 
        </p>
        <h4>Designing with constraints</h4>
        <p>Through past experiences, I’m familiar with designing within resource and 
            technological constraints. However, this was the first time I had to 
            balance various stakeholders and design within an existing product. These 
            constraints came with some extra considerations as I couldn’t just do 
            whatever was best for the user. I had to balance user needs with business 
            needs and consider how my designs would affect and fit into the rest of the 
            product. 
        </p>
        <h4>Storytelling & communication</h4>
        <p>I picked up a lot of soft skills over this summer, such as how to present my 
            work to stakeholders. Turns out that preparing your work for review and 
            feedback takes more time and effort than I thought. I found myself setting 
            aside time just to prepare for design reviews. I realized how valuable good 
            storytelling skills were and actively strived to strengthen those skills by 
            sharing my work often and with different audiences. In doing so, I learned 
            that a part of storytelling and communication is knowing your audience and 
            tailoring your presentation accordingly. 
        </p>
        <h4>Cross-functional collaboration </h4>
        <p>While this isn’t the first time I’ve worked in a cross-functional team, I 
            still learned a lot from the engineers, PM, content strategist, and user 
            researcher. Their input is invaluable in guiding and backing decisions. 
            Through this project, I learned how to truly leverage each partner, when to 
            loop in who, and how to turn feedback into productive discussions. While it 
            may open a few rabbit holes that can slow down the velocity, I realized that 
            sometimes, you just need to stop overthinking and bias towards action 
            despite ambiguity and uncertainty.
