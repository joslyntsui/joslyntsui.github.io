      <h1>Mentor Paging App</h1>
      <p>
        Role: Product Designer <br />
        Timeline: 2 Month (July - August 2019) <br />
        Team: 1 Product Designer, 1 Developer
      </p>
      <p>
        *I was the designer that picked this project up after it was started for
        StarterHacks 2019.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        StarterHacks is a weekend-long tech competition focused on beginners
        where students can come together to build a product and pitch their
        ideas to judges. Mentors are present throughout the entire weekend to
        offer guidance and support for the first-time hackers. Students can
        reach out to mentors for assistance in three streams: development,
        design, and business.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        For hackers to reach out to mentors for help, there is a dedicated
        channel within the hackathon wide Slack workspace where hackers can post
        their problems. Available mentors can then browse through the help
        requests and contact the hacker through slack. With over a thousand
        attendees, this channel can get cluttered and disorganized very quickly.
        Mentors get flooded and whether or not a hacker has been attended to is
        unclear.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        For StarterHacks 2019, the organizing team quickly created the Mentor
        Paging App. There are two types of users: hackers and mentors. Through
        the Paging App:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Hackers can submit a help request into a pool of requests</li>
        <li>Mentors can browse and filter through those requests</li>
        <li>
          Mentors can claim a request, attend to the hacker, and solve the
          request
        </li>
        <li>
          Hackers and mentors can easily access each other’s contact information
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I took over as the product designer for the app after StarterHacks 2019
        had concluded. My focus was to iterate and improve upon the existing app
        as well as work closely with the developers to ensure that the app can
        be developed in time.
      </p>
      <h4>Constraints</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Time (2 months)</li>
        <li>Resources (1 Designer, 1 Developer)</li>
        <li>Branding was a work in progress</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Google Material Design was used for wireframes so that the marketing
        team could just stylize the components with the appropriate colours and
        fonts.
      </p>
      <h4>Information Architecture</h4>
      <p>
        The user flow and information architecture was created with tech
        feasibility in mind. It was a tool for communication between the
        developer and I to understand where the large amounts of information was
        being pulled from and where it is being displayed and used.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are separate flows for the hackers and mentors but information is
        being passed between the two as they share the same database. Users will
        be presented with a different view and different functionalities
        depending on if they sign up as a hacker or a mentor, thus requiring a
        different user flow for each.
      </p>
      <br />
      <img src="Assets/information-architecture.png" width="100%" />
      <p>
        Within the flow, details pertaining to the type of information that
        would need to be stored is document as well as its origin. There are
        also notes made for the developer indicating behaviour.
      </p>
      <h4>2019 &rarr; 2020</h4>
      <p>
        I interviewed a few hackers and mentors from StarterHacks 2019 to learn
        more about their experience with the first iteration of the paging app.
      </p>
      <h5>Hacker View Insights and Improvements</h5>
      <p>Pain points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Many unnecessary requests in the pool and excess clutter on the mentor
          side – hackers had no way of accessing a request once it had been
          submitted
        </li>
        <li>
          Users felt left in the dark and confused about what happens after the
          request had been submitted – they had no access to the request and no
          updates after submission
        </li>
        <li>
          Too many emails – all notifications (request submission confirmation,
          request claimed, etc.) were sent via email
        </li>
        <li>
          Entry of information was repetitive and tedious – hackers had to enter
          some information that was constant (ex. Name, email, slack handle,
          etc.) each and every time they create a new request.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For the MVP, we added the ability to edit or delete a card even after it
        had been submitted in addition to the creation of a new help request to
        give users more autonomy and flexibility. It keeps the requests in the
        pool relevant and up-to-date. Clutter is reduced by allowing hackers to
        delete requests if they were able to solve it on their own after
        submission.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/edit-delete.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">Edit and Delete functions added for user automony</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Hackers can also see the status of the card so that they know if a
        mentor has seen it and is on the way to help them so that they can
        remain informed without their email inbox being blown up. If a card has
        been claimed, the hacker can also view the mentor’s profile (as shown
        above) to get a little background and contact information to help
        nurture hacker-mentor relationships.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/status-profile.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">

        requests and viewing a mentor’s profile after a request has been
        claimed.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The onboarding process was modified to include a profile creation upon
        sign up. Here, hackers can input their contact information which is then
        attached to each request that they create. Working with the developer,
        we made so that certain information is saved (ex. Hacker’s current
        location) and pre-filled each time and if the user were to change that
        information, it would be pre-filled with the updated information in
        future request creations. This change in the backend allows users to
        enter certain information only once and easily update information that
        changes semi-frequently.

      <p class="caption">
        Left: Hacker profile creation. Right: Location field is pre-filled based
        on what was last inputted in the previous request.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>Mentor View Insights and Improvements</h5>
      <p>Pain points:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Navigation and organization – having claimed request(s) live in a
          separate tab from the general request pool was redundant as mentors
          only claim and attend to one request at a time (edge case: claiming
          other tickets submitted by the same hacker)
        </li>
        <li>
          Unsure of what to search for – users didn’t know what they would use
          the search bar for as they have no way of knowing what requests exists
          in the pool
        </li>
        <li>
          Entry of information was repetitive and tedious – likewise to hackers,
          the mentors had to input their contact information every time they
          wanted to claim a card
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the 2020 iteration, there are no longer two tabs where the request
        pool and claimed request lived separately, the claimed ticket is pinned
        to the top of the screen and the pool continues to scroll beneath it.
        This reminds users of the ticket and prompts them to attend to the
        hacker rather than have it easily forgotten in a separate tab. It also
        makes the navigation simpler.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/mentor-nav.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">
        Far Left: 2018 Request pool and claimed request tab. Right: 2020 Mentor
        home screen; claimed ticket and request pool
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The search functionality was removed as the users indicated that it
        wasn’t of any use to them. The filter and sort function was kept as
        users noted that it was more practical since the requests can be
        bucketed together into their streams in an organized fashion.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/filter-sort.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">Filter and sort by functions</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Mentors also got their own profiles where contact information can be
        stored and linked to each card the claimed (similar to the hacker side
        with request submission). Additionally, the mentor is able to view the
        hacker’s profile via a request card and the hacker can view the mentor’s
        profile once their request has been claimed. This helps connect hacker
        to mentor in a much smoother and simpler way.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Usability Testing Results</h4>
      <p>
        We tested with frequent hackathon attendees (hackers and mentors) as
        well as users who were at StarterHacks 2019. There were two common
        points of confusion regarding both views:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Terminology & input format/content</li>
        <li>Sign-up process</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Users were most frequently confused by the use of the terms “stream” and
        “slack handle”. Stream is what StarterHacks uses to refer to the role of
        the hacker (development, design, or business); the confusion was easily
        cleared up by changing the input format to a dropdown. For “slack
        handle”, the input tag was changed to be more descriptive: “slack
        display name”. Additionally, I used placeholder text to provide examples
        of what information belongs in that text field. Field label was kept
        outside of the field to lessen the short-term memory load on the user.
        Adornments were used to help guide the user towards the correct input
        format.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/placeholder-adornments.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">Placeholder text and adornments</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Users were also confused by the sign-up process. They were unsure of
        whether or not they needed to input an email and password on the landing
        page if they wanted to sign up as the login and sign-up buttons were
        similar. To address this pain point, I changed the landing page so that
        the user is choosing to either sign-up or login without having to input
        any information yet to make the two flows more distinct and separate.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/sign-in-up.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">
        Distinct separate flows for signing up and signing in
      </p>
      <br />
      <h5>Hacker View Specific Results</h5>
      <p>
        Some users found the request creation form to be a bit long. All the
        questions on the form are necessary, so I broke up the form into
        sections with their own headers (information about the problem and how
        to find the hacker) to help keep the user focused and make the form more
        digestible by having bite size, similar themed sections.
      </p>
      <h5>Mentor View Specific Results</h5>
      <p>
        Users struggled to find and use the filter function and often resorted
        to process of elimination to figure it out as a result of the icon
        representing it being unintuitive. This was easily addressed by changing
        the icon to one that is familiar to users.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Dev Collaboration + Interaction Design</b><br />
        I had to work and think in a different space and work under different
        constraints and considerations on top of good design principles. It
        highlighted just how important communication is and how critical it is
        for designers to be able to understand dev language and to communicate
        effectively to someone who doesn’t speak design. Working this closely
        with a developer strengthened my interaction design skills as I thought
        less about how things looked (especially since the branding team would
        take over for high-fidelity) and more about what goes on behind the
        scenes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Usability Testing</b><br />
        Usability testing I learned very quickly that 90% of the time, my
        assumptions are wrong. It really taught me to get out of my own designer
        head and step into the user’s shoes. I learned how to formulate
        usability testing questions and how to turn the results and insights
        into meaningful design decisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Scoping + User Testing</b><br />
        I talked to various stakeholders before I designed anything; hackers,
        mentors, StarterHacks organizers/founders, and previous designers.
        Juggling the needs of the users (hacker and mentor), business goals, and
        tech feasibility really challenged my product thinking skills. There
        were a lot of tradeoffs and if I could re-do this part of the process, I
        would have started off with a much smaller scope and then adding as the
        project progressed. This made me a much more flexible and adaptable
        designer who is able to make compromises and come up with alternative
        solutions.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This project is far from done; there are so many other exciting features
        that have yet to be flushed out that will help connect hackers and
        mentors (but that’s a StarterHacks 2021 project). I am proud of the work
        that was done for the MVP (particularly the information architecture)
        but I would have liked to contribute more to the visual design and do
        some prototyping. With a longer timeline, I would also do more rounds of
        usability testing and explore how this project can be more than just a
        mentor paging app; how might it really be an asset in a hacker-mentor
        relationship?
