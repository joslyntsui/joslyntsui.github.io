        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>
          I interned at a small-scale start-up in the food and beverage industry
          at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Restaurants everywhere were
          being affected by the lockdown so Transparent Kitchen (TK) teamed up
          with
          <a href="https://app8solutions.com/" class="highlight swipe-up"
            >App8</a
          >
          to quickly pivot their business model to focus on getting local
          restaurants back on their feet.
        </p>
        <p>
          We had to move quickly to get a product out to market before too many
          restaurants had to shut down permanently. Being on a small but mighty
          design team of three, I had a lot of ownership over various design
          initiatives. From kickstarting Transparent Kitchen’s design system to
          launching the MVP, we were able to help restaurants open up again
          sooner rather than later.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Once dine-in was allowed again, restaurants weren’t able to operate at
          full capacity due to social distancing regulations, layoffs, and
          budget cuts. Both restaurant workers and customers felt anxiety about
          being in contact with other people outside of their bubbles. However,
          customers want to dine out again and restaurants want to get back to
          business. Both parties highly value the experience of eating in a
          restaurant.

          How might Transparent Kitchen & App8 help restaurants safely offer
          dine-in services in a pandemic with reduced staff?
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p class="callout">
          To protect customers and restaurant staff, we designed a white-label,
          contactless dine-in experience along with an end-to-end Point of Sales
          system (PoS).
        </p>
        <p>
          The user scans a QR code on their table to view the menu. From the
          menu, they are able to send their order to the kitchen and pay for
          their meal directly from their phone. The only time customers need to
          interact with the waiter is when their food is being brought to them.

          the product, restaurants are able to keep their sense of identity in
          their digital menus. By customizing the appearance of the interface,
          each restaurant can preserve their individuality even if their
          neighbour is also using the same technology.

        <h3>Feature Breakdown & Decisions</h3>
        <h2>Menu Discovery</h2>
        <p>
          Wanting to offer customers their full menus, restaurants didn’t want
          to condense their menus into one. They wanted to keep all their
          different menus (ie. lunch, dinner, drinks, dessert, etc.) and all the
          sections within each menu. We needed a way for regular customers to
          find their usual order while still encouraging them and new customers
          to explore and discover different dishes.
        </p>
        <h4>
          <b
            >Design Decision:
            <span class="highlight">Dropdown & Scrollable Tabs</span></b
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          Since users scan the QR code at the restaurant, the correct menu is
          presented to them based on the time of the scan. If the user is
          scanning at 7PM, the dinner menu is displayed. Other menus (ie. the
          lunch menu) may not be as relevant to the user at the moment so they
          are tucked away into a dropdown to not distract the user. However,
          some menus can be available at the same time so in the dropdown,
          they’re still easily accessible.

        <p class="caption">
          Left: Dropdowns for menu navigation. Right: Scrollable Tabs for
          section navigation
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Scrollable tabs are used to separate sections with a menu so that
          users can see all the sections at a glance and navigate directly to
          the one of interest. Should the user choose to scroll and browse
          through the menu, the tabs indicate to the user where they are within
          the menu.
        </p>
        <h5>Past Iteration</h5>
        <p>
          In early explorations, the menu name was in the place of “browse
          menus”. However, users indicated that due to the UI treatment, it
          wasn’t very clear that it was interactable. The font was a header font
          rather than an interactive one.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tk-header-iteration.png" width="100%" />
        <br />
        <p>
          By changing the font to be consistent with the other interactive
          elements and a copy update, it was clearer to users that there were
          other menus and how to access them.
        </p>

        <h4>
          <b>Design Decision: <span class="highlight">Filter</span></b>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Competitive analysis shows that no other menus (ie. UberEats,
          DoorDash, etc.) have the ability to filter menu items. Considering
          that many people have dietary restrictions (allergies, health,
          religious, etc.), browsing a menu can be frustrating. TK’s restaurant
          partners know that as well and take care in marking each dish’s
          allergens and diets. To reflect that, we added a filter functionality.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <video width="35%" autoplay loop muted>
            <source src="Assets/tk-filter.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>
        </div>
        <p>
          To remind users that they have filters selected and that the menu view
          is now altered, applied filter chips are placed at the top. Users also
          have the option to remove specific filters or reset the menu view
          completely without having to go back into the filter drawer.
        </p>

        <h5>Past Iteration</h5>
        <p>
          The first iteration of filters confused all five of the users in
          usability testing. It was designed based on how restaurants would tag
          the allergens and diets of each dish; which diets the item fits under
          and what allergens it contains. However, marking allergens in such a
          way causes it to behave opposite of typical filter actions when
          applied.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tk-filter-iteration.png" class="center-img" />
        <p>
          Selecting a filter chip should keep items that fit that parameter and
          for allergens, it’s counter intuitive to select parameters to be
          <i>removed</i>. To remedy this, labels were changed to
          “[allergen]-free” and the developers were able to flip the logic in
          the backend so that restaurants can keep tagging dishes that contain
          an allergen without going against filtering behaviour.
        </p>

        <h2>View Cart & Place Order</h2>
        <h4 style="margin-top: 1.2em">
          <b
            >Design Decision:
            <span class="highlight">A Non-Disruptive Cart</span></b
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          While a cart is a pretty standard pattern, we wanted to design it in
          such a way that it doesn’t interrupt the user’s browsing flow as the
          cart plays an important role in the user’s decision making process. By
          having the order summary pull up from the bottom in a drawer, it’s
          visible and accessible, allowing users to make decisions quickly based
          on the cart’s value and check out easily.
        </p>
        <div class="center">
          <video width="35%" autoplay loop muted>
            <source src="Assets/tk-cart-drawer.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>
        </div>
        <br />
        <h5>Past Iteration</h5>
        <p>
          Previously, the car existed on a separate page, following a common
          pattern. By taking the user away from the menu, it makes it more
          difficult for them to make decisions based on the cart’s value. It’s
          frustrating for the user to have to switch between two screens to make
          decisions. Additionally, since the user has left the menu, it’s not as
          likely that they would return to it. They’re more likely to continue
          to click through to placing the order.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tk-cart-iteration.png" class="center-img" />
        <p class="caption">Iteration 1</p>
        <p>
          Iterating upon that, the final design of the bottom drawer not only
          enables users to make decisions quickly and easily, but it also
          encourages users to continue browsing and adding more items.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tk-cart-still.png" class="center-img" />
        <br /><br />

        <h2>Checkout Flows</h2>
        <p>
          There are two ways for users to pay for their meals: at the end of
          their meal (an open tab) or with every order placed (close tab).
        </p>
        <p>
          The encouraged flow is to open a tab however, the user will need an
          account. This option allows users to place multiple, distinct orders
          and pay with a stored card at the end to close out their bill. An open
          tab is traditionally how the checkout and payment process goes when
          dining in. This flow also supports a new incoming feature: bill
          splitting.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tk-open-tab-flow.png" class="center-img" />
        <p class="caption">Account user, ongoing tab flow</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          An account is required for security. The customer must input their
          card information before placing their order so that they can be
          charged for their meal even if they leave without formally closing out
          their bill. An account ensures that the user’s card information is
          stored securely. Customers leaving without paying for their meal was a
          concern to many restaurants due to reduced number of staff who are
          also managing an increase of take-out orders.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the user chooses to not create an account, they have the option of
          paying with each order placed. Everytime the user places an order,
          they will need to enter their card information each time.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tk-no-tab-flow.png" class="center-img" />
        <p class="caption">Guest user, no tab flow</p>
        <br />

        <h4>
          <b
            >Design Decision:
            <span class="highlight">Interstitial Screens</span></b
          >
        </h4>
        <p>
          To introduce and convince users to create an account, we used
          interstitial screens to prompt users. We A/B tested a dialog
          interstitial screen against a full screen one.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tk-interstitial.png" class="center-img" />
        <p class="caption">Left: Dialog. Right: Full screen.</p>
        <p>4/5 users preferred the full screen version for various reasons:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            They liked the illustration and said that they are more likely to
            read the value prop since they generally want to dismiss dialogs
            asap.
          </li>
          <li>
            It was easier and faster for users to find a way to dismiss the
            dialog whereas it took them longer to close the full screen one.
          </li>
          <li>
            Two users said that they would go ahead and create an account since
            that was the first action they saw
            <a
              class="highlight swipe-up"
              href="https://www.uxtoast.com/ux-laws/fittss-law"
              >(Fitt’s Law)</a
            >
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />

        <h4>
          <b
            >Decision: <span class="highlight">Order History & Updates</span></b
          >
          <br />
        </h4>
        <p>
          With an ongoing tab, users can see what they’ve ordered so far and
          place new orders. By keeping users informed on the status of their
          order, it reduces the need to interact with their server.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tk-order-history.png" class="center-img" />

        <h5>Validating the Feature</h5>
        <p>
          While some users didn’t completely understand the difference between
          an ongoing tab and paying out the bill right away, 4/5 preferred to
          dine with an open tab once they figured it out. Many users noted the
          similarity to putting their card down at a bar so a quick copy update
          mitigated the confusion and helped first time users understand what it
          is right away. 3/5 users liked being able to keep track of what they
          had ordered and the reassurance that the kitchen received their order.
        </p>
        <p>
          Due to how the feature mirrors a pre-pandemic dine-in experience,
          users liked the familiarity and said that an ongoing tab made more
          sense to them in a sit-in context. Two users said that they are more
          likely to stay longer and order more because they haven’t paid yet;
          paying the bill feels like closure. Another user said that this option
          allowed more flexibility in case there was something wrong with their
          order or if they wanted to make changes after the order was sent.
        </p>
        <br />
        <!---
        <h2>Security: Card Storing</h2>
        <p>
          Many users expressed concerns and uneasiness around providing their
          card information. While they understand why it’s being asked, they
          feel uncomfortable not knowing how it will be stored and if it will be
          stored. We mitigated those feelings of unease by informing the user
          how long their information will be stored and giving account users the
          option to have their information remembered for next time, if they
          wish.
        </p>

        <br />

        <h5>Reducing Points of Friction</h5>
        <p>
          Working with engineering, we lessened two points of friction so that
          users can accomplish their tasks easily. Account creation and payment
          information entry are two tedious but necessary parts of the flow.
        </p>
        <p>
          While users do have the option to proceed without an account, they are
          encouraged to create one for more features and a better experience. If
          they do choose to open an account, we make it quick and easy for them
          by having social sign on as an option.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tk-friction.png" class="center-img" />
        <p class="caption">
          Left: Social sign on. Right: Autofill & scan credit card.
        </p>
        <p>
          Entering card information can be tedious and annoying. However, 90% of
          surveyed users have their card information stored in their phones (ie.
          Google Pay, Apple Pay, etc.) or browsers. To make the process of
          entering card details easier, users can auto-fill their information or
          scan their card rather than entering the information manually.
        </p>

        <h2>Menu Customizations</h2>
        <p>
          To deliver the contactless dine-in experience, there is a B2B side of
          the product. Since this is a white-label product, TK builds the
          technology but each individual restaurant can skin the UI to match

        <p>
          To build an unique menu, there are a variety of different elements
          that can be customized by restaurant owners. To find the best way to
          organize all the different settings, we conducted a card sorting
          activity with all customizable elements. Here are the results:

        <br />
        <p>
          Afterwards, we researched menus and thought about all the individual
          properties (ie. fonts, colour, stroke, etc.) that would be necessary
          for each element to recreate each physical menu in a digital space.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p class="callout">
          MVP launch! 🚀 Selected restaurants are currently using TK’s ordering
          system to safely serve customers during the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm incredibly proud to have been a part of the process of launching
          TK’s product to market.

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <h4>Design Ops</h4>
        <p>
          Being one of the first TK design hires and on such a small team, I got
          to dip my toes in things other than just design. Since TK has never
          had a proper design team before, I got to do some design ops work.
          From building their design system to defining design processes, I
          really had to think about the way we design as a team and how to
          improve that. I even pushed for the team to switch to Figma and
          ensured that the new tool was adopted.
        </p>
        <p>
          While it was a lot of responsibility to lay down that foundation, I’m
          proud of having been a core pillar in setting TK up for the future.
          I’m glad that even though my entire internship was fully remote, I was
          able to make such a large and meaningful impact.
        </p>
        <h4>Usability & User Testing</h4>
        <p>
          As for design takeaways, I gained experience in structuring and
          conducting usability tests. I learned about best practices for running
          user/usability tests and what metrics to use to track results. One
          thing that really stood out to me was that validating a feature
          doesn’t always mean good usability and vice versa. Those are two
          different types of tests with two different goals that give two
          different results.
        </p>
        <h4>Prototyping</h4>
        <p>
          If a picture is worth 1000 words then a prototype is worth a million.
          Communicating designs for development can be difficult and confusing
          when only words are being used. A quick and simple prototype will get
          the point across much faster and clearer.
        </p>
        <h4>Scalability</h4>
        <p>
          The last design takeaway is learning how to build for the future and
          thinking ahead. Even though we were building an initial MVP, we still
          had to keep what’s to come in mind. We had to ensure that the work we
          were doing would set up future features and how they fit in. It’s a
          careful balancing act of working to get a product to market and
          considering how to build upon it.
