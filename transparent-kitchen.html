      <h1>Transparent Kitchen</h1>
      <p>
        Role: Product Designer <br />
        Timeline: 6 Weeks <br />
        <br />
      </p>

      <h2>Context</h2>
      <p>
        I interned at a small-scale start-up in the food and beverage industry
        at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. Restaurants everywhere were
        being affected by the lockdown so Transparent Kitchen (TK) teamed up
        with App8 to quickly pivot their business model to focus on getting
        local restaurants back on their feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        We had to move quickly to get a product out to market before too many
        restaurants had to shut down permanently. Being on a small but mighty
        design team of three, I had a lot of ownership over various design
        initiatives. From kickstarting Transparent Kitchen’s design system to
        launching the MVP, we were able to help restaurants open up again sooner
        rather than later.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>The Problem</h2>
      <p>
        Once dining-in was allowed again, restaurants weren’t able to operate at
        full capacity due to social distancing regulations and decrease of
        staff. Both restaurant workers and customers felt anxiety about being in
        contact with other people outside of their bubbles. However, customers
        want to dine out again and restaurants want to get back to business.
        Both parties highly value the experience of eating in a restaurant.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p>
        OTo protect customers and restaurant staff, we designed a contactless
        dine-in experience along with an end-to-end PoS with customizable UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user scans a QR code on their table to view the menu. From the menu,
        they are able to send their order to the kitchen and pay for their meal
        directly from their phone. The only time customers need to interact with
        the waiter is when their food is being brought to them.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/tk-solution.png" width="100%" /> <br /><br />

      <p>
        Restaurants are able to keep their sense of identity in their digital
        menus by incorporating their brand styling. By customizing the
        appearance of the ordering experience, each restaurant can preserve
        their individuality even if their neighbour is also using the same
        technology.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/tk-customization.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">Examples of custom menus</p>

      <h2>Feature Breakdown & Decisions</h2>
      <h4>Menu Discovery</h4>
      <p>
        BWanting to offer customers their full menus, restaurants didn’t want to
        condense their menus into one. They wanted to keep all their different
        menus (ie. lunch, dinner, drinks, dessert, etc.) and all the sections
        within each menu. We needed a way for regular customers to find their
        usual order while still encouraging them and new customers to explore
        and discover different dishes.
      </p>
      <h6>
        <b
          >Design Decision:
          <span class="highlight">Dropdown & Scrollable Tabs</span></b
        >
      </h6>
      <p>
        Since users scan the QR code at the restaurant, the correct menu is
        presented to them based on the time of the scan. If the user is scanning
        at 7PM, the dinner menu is displayed. Other menus (ie. the lunch menu)
        may not be as relevant to the user at the moment so they are tucked away
        into a dropdown to not distract the user. However, some menus can be
        available at the same time so in the dropdown, they’re still easily
        accessible.
      </p>

        <video width="35%" autoplay loop muted>

        </video>
      </div>
      <p class="caption">
        Left: Dropdowns for menu navigation. Right: Scrollable Tabs for section
        navigation
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Scrollable tabs are used to separate sections with a menu so that users
        can see all the sections at a glance and navigate directly to the one of
        interest. Should the user choose to scroll and browse through the menu,
        the tabs indicate to the user where they are within the menu.
      </p>
      <h5>Past Iteration</h5>
      <p>
        In early explorations, the menu name was in the place of “browse menus”.
        However, users indicated that due to the UI treatment, it wasn’t very
        clear that it was interactable. The font was a header font rather than
        an interactive one.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/tk-header-iteration.png" width="100%" />
      <br />
      <p>
        By changing the font to be consistent with the other interactive
        elements and a copy update, it was clearer to users that there were
        other menus and how to access them.
      </p>

      <h6>
        <b>Design Decision: <span class="highlight">Filter</span></b>
      </h6>
      <p>
        Competitive analysis shows that no other menus (ie. UberEats, DoorDash,
        etc.) have the ability to filter menu items. Considering that many
        people have dietary restrictions (allergies, health, religious, etc.),
        browsing a menu can be frustrating. TK’s restaurant partners know that
        as well and take care in marking each dish’s allergens and diets. To
        reflect that, we added a filter functionality.
      </p>
      <div class="center">
        <video width="35%" autoplay loop muted>
          <source src="Assets/tk-filter.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        </video>
      </div>
      <p>
        To remind users that they have filters selected and that the menu view
        is now altered, applied filter chips are placed at the top. Users also
        have the option to remove specific filters or reset the menu view
        completely without having to go back into the filter drawer.
      </p>

      <h5>Past Iteration</h5>
      <p>
        The first iteration of filters confused all five of the users in
        usability testing. It was designed based on how restaurants would tag
        the allergens and diets of each dish; which diets the item fits under
        and what allergens it contains. However, marking allergens in such a way
        causes it to behave opposite of typical filter actions when applied.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/tk-filter-iteration.png" width="100%" />
      <p>
        Selecting a filter chip should keep items that fit that parameter and
        for allergens, it’s counter intuitive to select parameters to be
        <i>removed</i>. To remedy this, labels were changed to “[allergen]-free”
        and the developers were able to flip the logic in the backend so that
        restaurants can keep tagging dishes that contain an allergen without
        going against filtering behaviour.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>View Cart & Place Order</h4>
      <h6 style="margin-top: 1.2em">
        <b
          >Design Decision:
          <span class="highlight">A Non-Disruptive Cart</span></b
        >
      </h6>
      <p>
        While a cart is a pretty standard pattern, we wanted to design it in
        such a way that it doesn’t interrupt the user’s browsing flow. By having
        the order summary pull up from the bottom in a drawer, it’s still easily
        accessible without being disruptive.
      </p>
      <div class="center">
        <video width="35%" autoplay loop muted>
          <source src="Assets/tk-cart-drawer.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        </video>
      </div>
      <h5>Past Iteration</h5>
      <p>
        Previously, cart existed on a separate page, following a common pattern.
        Since the user has left the menu, it’s not as likely that they would
        return to it. They’re more likely to continue to click through to
        placing the order.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/tk-cart-iteration.png" width="100%" />
      <p>
        Iterating upon that, the final design of the bottom drawer is not only
        less disruptive, but it also encourages users to continue browsing and
        adding more items.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h4>Checkout Flows</h4>
      <p>
        There are two ways for users to pay for their meals: at the end of their
        meal (an open tab) or with every order placed (close tab).
      </p>
      <p>
        The encouraged flow is to open a tab however, the user will need an
        account. This option allows users to place multiple, distinct orders and
        pay with a stored card at the end to close out their bill. An open tab
        is traditionally how the checkout and payment process goes when dining
        in. This flow also supports a new incoming feature: bill splitting.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/tk-open-tab-flow.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">Account user, ongoing tab flow</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        An account is required for security. The customer must input their card
        information before placing their order so that they can be charged for
        their meal even if they leave without formally closing out their bill.
        An account ensures that the user’s card information is stored securely.
        Customers leaving without paying for their meal was a concern to many
        restaurants due to reduced number of staff who are also managing an
        increase of take-out orders.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the user chooses to not create an account, they have the option of
        paying with each order placed. Everytime the user places an order, they
        will need to enter their card information each time.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/tk-no-tab-flow.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">Guest user, no tab flow</p>

      <h6>
        <b
          >Design Decision:
          <span class="highlight">Interstitial Screens</span></b
        >
      </h6>
      <p>
        To introduce and convince users to create an account, we used
        interstitial screens to prompt users. We A/B tested a dialog
        interstitial screen against a full screen one.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/tk-interstitial.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">Left: Dialog. Right: Full screen.</p>
      <p>4/5 users preferred the full screen version for various reasons:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          They liked the illustration and said that they are more likely to read
          the value prop since they generally want to dismiss dialogs asap.
        </li>
        <li>
          It was easier and faster for users to find a way to dismiss the dialog
          whereas it took them longer to close the full screen one.
        </li>
        <li>
          Two users said that they would go ahead and create an account since
          that was the first action they saw
          <a
            class="highlight swipe-up"
            href="https://www.uxtoast.com/ux-laws/fittss-law"
            >(Fitt’s Law)</a
          >
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h6>
        <b>Decision: <span class="highlight">Order History & Updates</span></b>
      </h6>
      <p>
        With an ongoing tab, users can see what they’ve ordered so far and place
        new orders. By keeping users informed on the status of their order, it
        reduces the need to interact with their server.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/tk-order-history.png" width="100%" />

      <h5>Validating the Feature</h5>
      <p>
        While some users didn’t completely understand the difference between an
        ongoing tab and paying out the bill right away, 4/5 preferred to dine
        with an open tab once they figured it out. Many users noted the
        similarity to putting their card down at a bar so a quick copy update
        mitigated the confusion and helped first time users understand what it
        is right away. 3/5 users liked being able to keep track of what they had
        ordered and the reassurance that the kitchen received their order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to how the feature mirrors a pre-pandemic dine-in experience, users
        liked the familiarity and said that an ongoing tab made more sense to
        them in a sit-in context. Two users said that they are more likely to
        stay longer and order more because they haven’t paid yet; paying the
        bill feels like closure. Another user said that this option allowed more
        flexibility in case there was something wrong with their order or if
        they wanted to make changes after the order was sent.
      </p>

      <h4>Security: Card Storing</h4>
      <p>
        Many users expressed concerns and uneasiness around providing their card
        information. While they understand why it’s being asked, they feel
        uncomfortable not knowing how it will be stored and if it will be
        stored. We mitigated those feelings of unease by informing the user how
        long their information will be stored and giving account users the
        option to have their information remembered for next time, if they wish.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/tk-security.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">
        Left: Letting guest users know that their information won't be stored.
        Right: Giving account users the option to have their information stored.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h5>Reducing Points of Friction</h5>
      <p>
        Working with engineering, we lessened two points of friction so that
        users can accomplish their tasks easily. Account creation and payment
        information entry are two tedious but necessary parts of the flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        While users do have the option to proceed without an account, they are
        encouraged to create one for more features and a better experience. If
        they do choose to open an account, we make it quick and easy for them by
        having social sign on as an option.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/tk-friction.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">
        Left: Social sign on. Right: Autofill & scan credit card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Entering card information can be tedious and annoying. However, 90% of
        surveyed users have their card information stored in their phones (ie.
        Google Pay, Apple Pay, etc.) or browsers. To make the process of
        entering card details easier, users can auto-fill their information or
        scan their card rather than entering the information manually.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h5>Menu Customizations</h5>
      <p>
        To deliver the contactless dine-in experience, there is a B2B side of
        the product. While TK builds the technology, each individual restaurant
        can skin the UI to match their brand.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/tk-restaurant-menus.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">Digital menus based off of real restaurant menus.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        To build an unique menu, there are a variety of different elements that
        can be customized by restaurant owners. To find the best way to organize
        all the different settings, we conducted a card sorting activity. Here
        are the results:
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/tk-cart-sort.png" width="100%" /> <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        Afterwards, we researched menus and thought about all the customizable
        properties (ie. fonts, colour, stroke, etc.) that would be necessary for
        each element to recreate each menu in a digital space.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/tk-properties.png" width="100%" />
      <br />
      <br />
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        MVP launch! I was incredibly proud to have been a part of the process of
        launching TK’s product to market. Selected restaurants are currently
        using TK’s ordering system to safely serve customers during the
        pandemic.
      </p>
      <br />

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <h6 class="highlight" style="margin-top: 1em">Design Ops</h6>
      <p>
        Being one of the first TK design hires and on such a small team, I got
        to dip my toes in things other than just design. Since TK has never had
        a proper design team before, I got to do some design ops work. From
        building their design system to defining design processes, I really had
        to think about the way we design as a team and how to improve that. I
        even pushed for the team to switch to Figma and ensured that the new
        tool was adopted.
      </p>
      <p>
        While it was a lot of responsibility to lay down that foundation, I’m
        proud of having been a core pillar in setting TK up for the future. I’m
        glad that even though my entire internship was fully remote, I was able
        to make such a large and meaningful impact.
      </p>
      <h6 class="highlight" style="margin-top: 1em">
        Usability & User Testing
      </h6>
      <p>
        As for design takeaways, I gained experience in structuring and
        conducting usability tests. I learned about best practices for running
        user/usability tests and what metrics to use to track results. One thing
        that really stood out to me was that validating a feature doesn’t always
        mean good usability and vice versa. Those are two different types of
        tests with two different goals that give two different results.
      </p>
      <h6 class="highlight" style="margin-top: 1em">Prototyping</h6>
      <p>
        If a picture is worth 1000 words then a prototype is worth a million.
        Communicating designs for development can be difficult and confusing
        when only words are being used. A quick and simple prototype will get
        the point across much faster and clearer.
      </p>
      <h6 class="highlight" style="margin-top: 1em">Scalability</h6>
      <p>
        The last design takeaway is learning how to build for the future and
        thinking ahead. Even though we were building an initial MVP, we still
        had to keep what’s to come in mind. We had to ensure that the work we
        were doing would set up future features and how they fit in. It’s a
        careful balancing act of working to get a product to market and
        considering how to build upon it.
