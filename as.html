      <h1>Art & Science Digital Experience Design</h1>
      <p>
        Role: Design Intern <br />
        Timeline: May - August 2019
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I was a Design Intern during the summer of 2019 at Art & Science Digital
        Experience Design, a design agency in Toronto. I got to work with the
        development team, the performance marketing team, project and account
        managers, and other designers on a variety of projects for various
        clients. As some of these projects are under NDA, I can’t share my work
        publicly. Most of my work was focused on visual and interaction design
        as well as providing support to the developers and UX strategist. In my
        designs, I work to meet technical and clients’ business needs while
        advocating for the user. I also presented designs to clients,
        communicating design rationale, listening to their needs, and looking
        for alternative solutions and compromise.
      </p>
      <p>
        My day-to-day involved working on anywhere from 1 to 5+ different
        projects. There was not a single moment where I had nothing to do. I
        would attend meetings, both internal and with clients. I might go from
        strategy planning to building a design system for the devs to UX work.
        From the performance marketing team, I got to learn about web
        accessibility and SEO. It was a very generalist role and I got to work
        with everyone at the agency. I learned so much from everyone and I had
        amazing mentors. The A&S team and culture at A&S made this summer a
        truly memorable experience. I even got my own avatar!
