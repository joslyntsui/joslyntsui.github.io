      <p>
        I studied abroad in Singapore for a semester in 2019. While my classes
        kept me in Singapore during the weekdays, most of my weekends were spent
        travelling with other exchange students. In one semester, I ended up
        going to Japan, Korea, Thailand, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Taiwan.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we had a blast, we also struggled a lot with getting around. Since
        we’re all students, we were travelling on a budget. We generally avoided
        taking taxis and Ubers/Grabs because public transportation was a lot
        cheaper. Needless to say, we got lost a couple of times. So I thought to
        myself: how might we make navigating a foreign country easier for
        travellers on a budget?
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Personal Goals</h2>
      <p>
        As this was a passion project, I wanted to use this opportunity to grow
        and develop my skills in various areas of design. I wanted to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Conduct my own user research and user testing, specifically user
          interviews rather than just surveys
        </li>
        <li>Conduct market research</li>
        <li>
          Strengthen my product thinking by analyzing research findings to
          develop a solution
        </li>
        <li>Explore different testing methods</li>
        <li>
          Really focus on the user experience and understand the users’ pain
          points
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>Problem Statement</h2>

      <h2>User Research</h2>
      <p>
        We came up with some questions to learn about the users' current
        experience with navigating a new environment. To begin, we built a
        holistic picture of a user's journey, from deciding on a destination, to
        their arrival, and then their day to day transportation experience. The
        questions aimed to find out about their research process (if any), how
        their experiences varied with location, as well as what their obstacles
        and how they overcame them. We wanted to get complete stories out of
        each user's experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I interviewed 5 users while I was abroad, these consisted of other
        exchange students who were also travelling on a budget. There is also
        additional information I gathered from casual conversations with my
        travel buddies. Grace and I also briefly surveyed and interviewed a
        handful of users back in Canada who have travelled as well. The
        participation criteria was:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Have travelled to and around a foreign country</li>
        <li>Travelled on a budget</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>User Research Insights</h2>
      <p><b>Travel and Research Tools</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          100% of users say that they use Google Maps when travelling (where
          available)
        </li>
        <li>Travel blogs/forums are a popular research tool</li>
        <li>
          80% of users don’t officially do research before arrival
          <ul>
            <li>
              Typically will be looking up places to go rather than how to get
              there
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Pain Points</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Language barrier: 4/5 users say that the majority of their struggles
          were caused by the language barrier
          <ul>
            <li>
              What is shown on Google Maps doesn’t always match what is written
              on signs in reality
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Buses: 60% of users say that they had difficulty identifying bus
          stops, buses, and which direction the buses were going
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Other Considerations</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Biggest factors that determine the mode of transportation chosen (in
          order):
          <ul>
            <li>Cost</li>
            <li>Time</li>
            <li>Convenience</li>
            <li>Safety</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          The mode of transportation will vary depending on if the user is
          travelling alone or with others
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>User Journey</h2>
      <p>Here’s what a user’s typical journey looks like:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Book flights to destination</li>
        <li>
          Google search attractions at destination and book accommodations based
          on location of attractions
        </li>
        <li>
          Google search how to get from the airport to the city/accommodation OR
          figure it out upon arrival either via Google Maps or asking at the
          airport
        </li>
        <li>
          Figure out the logistics of public transportation at the airport by
          going to the city’s public transportation’s help desk
        </li>
        <li>Arrive at accommodation</li>
        <li>
          Use Google Maps to:
          <ul>
            <li>Figure out how to get to a destination</li>
            <li>Explore what is in the are (ex. Food, attractions, etc.)</li>
            <li>Plan out schedule</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Consult general Google search to fill in gaps in information (if any)
          that Google Maps may missed
        </li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <h2>Product Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        As users were figuring out things as they went on the go, we started
        with a solution that was mobile friendly. We were debating between a
        stand-alone app or web app but decided to design an integration with
        Google Maps instead considering that 100% of the users said that they
        rely heavily on it. A few users also mentioned that they found it
        annoying to have to download apps and then uninstall it afterwards when
        they have no more purpose. The pain point that we wanted to focus on was
        the language barrier as it was the source of the majority of the users’
        struggles.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Lost In Translation</h4>
      <p>
        Users found that Google Maps would often romanize station and stop names
        but the names written on signs in reality are often in the local
        language. This leads to a disconnect that causes users to be confused
        and struggle with identifying where they are and where they need to go.
        On the flip side, there are certain regions where station and stop names
        are shown in Google Maps only in the local language. Users noted that
        while they are able to match what is shown in the app to signs in
        reality, it’s difficult if they are completely unfamiliar with the
        language and with the short amount of time that they have
        stopped/passing through a station/stop.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/romanized-local.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">
        Left: Romanized station names in Japan. Right: Station names written in
        Thai only in Thailand
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        We decided to add both the romanized name as well as the name in the
        local language. That way, users have two references to help them orient
        themselves. Users noted that with just the romanized name itself, they
        would get confused by other stations with similar sounding names. By
        having the local name, users can “picture” match it with the signs to
        ensure that they are where they need to be.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Sound it Out</h4>
      <p>
        We were informed that most transportation systems will audioally
        announce the upcoming stop/station. This, along with the pre-existing
        romanized names on Google Maps, users could get a sense of where they
        were. However, users are unable to discern tones or proper pronunciation
        if they are unfamiliar with the language which can be confusing if there
        are other stations of similar sounding names.
      </p>
      <p>
        The feature we added was an audio feature, similar to the one in Google
        Translate. Users are able to play the name of the station (spoken in the
        local language) so that they can verify with the announcements.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>In Between</h4>
      <p>
        Currently, Google Maps displays the transition between modes of
        transportation (bus to subway/MRT and vice versa) but it only displays
        the distance and walk time. When the user taps into its details, it
        zooms into the map showing the path. However, many stations are above or
        below ground with few entrances. Additionally, some stations can get
        rather complicated, whether it be that it’s a transfer point and has
        multiple platforms, hidden away, or in a really busy area (ex. In a
        mall). 80% of users said that they struggled to navigate the stations.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/in-between.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">
        Left: Description of transfer point. Right: What is shown when user taps
        on “Walk about 2 min”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Google Maps provides a great amount of detail for buses and subways/MRT,
        but not for the steps in between. The app also provides good directions
        for getting around by foot. We wanted to bridge the steps between modes
        of transportation to make the entire journey for the user seamless and
        smooth. We created a “walking tour” of the station in the same style as
        Google Maps’ walking directions.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/walking-directions.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">
        Left: Steps detailing walking directions. Right: Photos to help orient
        the user.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Pictures are included to help visually guide the user through the
        station with directions indicating not just the flat plane but also the
        vertical plane (ex. How many floors up or down to go). It is designed in
        the same style as the walking directions in Google Maps since users are
        already familiar with it.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h4>Flexible Integration</h4>
      <p>
        We chose to integrate our product with Google Maps to decrease the
        effort that users would have to go through to use it. Most people have
        Google Maps as it is installed on every Android device and even iOS
        users tend to have a strong preference for Google Maps over Apple Maps.
        Surveyed users noted that they still use Google Maps even when they’re
        in a city that they’re familiar with (not just when they’re travelling)
        to check bus times, traffic, estimated time of arrival, or when going
        somewhere new. Google Maps is essential for both travellers and locals.
      </p>
      <p>
        To keep the versatility of Google Maps, we designed it so that our
        product is a travel mode that can be easily toggled on or off to
        accommodate the varying needs of users. This saves the users the hassle
        of downloading and uninstalling an app before and after their trip. All
        users surveyed said that they really like the features offered by Google
        Maps and are generally happy with it even though it’s not perfect.
        Having Travel Mode integrated with Google Maps in its settings means
        that it builds upon its strengths while filling in the gaps that appear
        during travels.

      <h2>Takeaways so far</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Being able to conduct user interviews vs. just conducting surveys is
          incredibly valuable and insightful. A lot of the insights that I
          learned were through interviews where I was able to ask the user to
          elaborate more on an interesting point and dig deeper.
        </li>
        <li>
          When analyzing user research results, taking a step back and looking
          at the bigger picture is helpful. I found myself getting caught up
          over each and every individual user’s struggles that it took me a
          while to realize that even though each struggle is different, there
          was a common root.
        </li>
        <li>
          Market research helps identify gaps and pain points. Understanding
          what is already out there and digging into why users’ still have the
          pain points that they do points us to the direction of a cause. This
          provides another perspective, helping me understand the pain points
          better.
        </li>
        <li>
          Working in ambiguity isn’t as scary as it seems! Discovering more
          about the problem and learning about users’ experiences is really
          interesting and exploring the problem space is rather delightful. It’s
          all a part of problem solving and it’s actually kind of fun.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <h2>Challenges</h2>
      <p>
        Keeping all the functionalities that users currently love while adding
        the additional features without the interface getting too cluttered.
        There is a lot of information being presented and it’s difficult to
        display it all in a neat way.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Next Steps</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Finish up the UI</li>
        <li>
          Conduct usability testing
          <ul>
            <li>A/B testing</li>
