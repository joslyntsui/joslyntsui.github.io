          (BEP) is a non-profit organization that provides students’ with career
          exploration opportunities. One of their primary initiatives is
          connecting teachers with industry professionals and bringing them into
          their classrooms to host workshops and presentations.
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
          UW Blueprint partnered with BEP to improve their current process of
          matching volunteer industry professionals with educators.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Previously, the web app portal they were using was outdated and the
          majority of the work was being done manually by BEP’s program
          coordinator. Educators would submit event opportunities via the portal
          and BEP would review each one and reach out individually to volunteer
          speakers. Even the process of adding educators and industry
          professionals to BEP’s database was done manually.
        </p>
        <p>
          This process is not scalable nor efficient. As BEP continues to grow,
          more requests for volunteers come in.
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
          How might UW Blueprint relieve the manual labour being done by BEP
          personnel and engage users to create connections themselves?
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p class="callout">
          Our team developed a web app where educators can connect with industry
          professionals who want to support youth career development and
          industry professionals can find opportunities to educate youth about
          their field of work.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>Arriving at the Solution</h3>
        <h2>User Research Findings</h2>
        <p>
          We conducted six user interviews (three educators and three
          volunteers) with BEP’s existing users to learn more about their
          frustrations with the current portal. From our findings, we created a
          persona for each type of user.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-persona.png" width="100%" />
        <p><b>Key findings:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Both educators and volunteers prefer to use emails as their primary
            method of communication and they check their emails frequently
          </li>
          <li>
            While educators often check their emails on mobile while on the go,
            they generally access the BEP portal on desktop
          </li>
          <li>
            Educators will only access the portal if there is an event coming
            up. They typically host 1-2 events once every few months
          </li>
          <li>
            Volunteers don’t go on the BEP portal often as there aren’t many
            actions for them to take other than keeping their profiles up to
            date
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Given the users’ preference for email communication, we worked them
          into the user flow so that users don’t miss important information (ie.
          invitations to events, event changes, etc.) as they are not in the
          habit of logging onto the BEP portal often. We wanted to ensure that
          the new portal fit seamlessly into their existing habits and
          behaviours. We worked closely with the developers to smooth out the
          transitions between email and the portal by using tokenized links.

        <p class="caption">Left: Educator flow. Right: Volunteer flow.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>Requirements</h2>
        <p>
          From our user research findings and business considerations from BEP,
          we identified a list of features that are needed to help users
          accomplish their tasks.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            A way for educators and volunteers to sign up for the BEP platform
          </li>
          <li>A way for educators to post and share event opportunities</li>
          <li>
            A way for volunteers to browse upcoming opportunities and apply to
            be a facilitator
          </li>
          <li>
            A way for educators to browse volunteers and invite them to events
          </li>
          <li>
            A way for educators and volunteers to keep track of their upcoming
            and past event(s)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <br />

        <h3>Feature Breakdown & Decisions</h3>
        <h2>Sign-Up</h2>
        <p>
          Before new educators or volunteers can access the portal, they need to
          submit an application to BEP first.
        </p>
        <h4>
          Design Decision:
          <span class="highlight">Progressive Disclosure</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
          BEP has a large database of partner companies and organizations in
          which volunteer industry professionals are a part of. In their
          application, volunteers need to state who their employer is. If a
          volunteer's employer is not listed, they will need to provide
          additional details (ie. organization's sector, contact information,
          etc.) so that BEP can add them to their database.
        </p>
        <p>
          To not overwhelm the user with too many actions, the additional fields
          are not displayed unless the user indicates that their employer was
          not listed. The actions to add a new organization is not revealed
          unless requested. Furthermore, to save the user from having to scroll
          through the list to find their employer, they are able to type their
          employer name. Only then if no employers by that name exists in the
          database does the option to add a new employer appear.
        </p>
        <video width="100%" autoplay loop muted>
          <source src="Assets/bep-progressivedisclosure.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        </video>
        <p>
          Dashed lines link the fields together to reduce cognitive load by
          grouping related information together.
        </p>
        <h5>Past Iterations</h5>
        <p>
          In the first iteration of the sign-up form for volunteers, users whose
          employers weren’t in the database would submit their employer’s
          information in a modal. The problem is that once the user has finished
          filling out the fields in the modal and saved their answers, it isn’t
          displayed on the main form, making it unclear to the user whether or
          not their answers were saved and submitted. This also makes it tricky
          for the user to edit their answers and review the overall form before
          submission.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-new-employer-iteration.png" width="100%" />
        <p class="caption">Iteration 1</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Additionally, when users of a new employer first search for their
          employer from the dropdown (and no result is found), seeing “employer
          not found” denotes negative feelings and may discourage them from
          adding it since the field is optional or confuse users on how to
          proceed with the lack of guidance and actionable items.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-employer-not-found.png" width="100%" />
        <p class="caption">"Employer not found"</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The users feel as though they’ve hit a dead end whereas with
          progressive disclosure, the process flows smoothly into adding a new
          employer’s information as there are clear actions forward.
          Furthermore, no fields are hidden away in a modal, keeping the user
          aware and informed on all their answers.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-progressive-disclosure.png" width="100%" />
        <p class="caption">
          Left: Progress disclosure trigger. Right: New fields, progressively
          disclosed.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4>
          Design Decision:
          <span class="highlight">Multi-Step Form + Stepper</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
          A lot of information is required of the volunteer so the application
          form is quite long. To make the process less daunting, the form was
          broken up into sections with a stepper to inform the user where they
          are in the process and how much is left to complete.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-stepper.png" width="100%" />
        <br /><br /><br />
        <h2>Dashboard & Event Details</h2>
        <p>
          Educators and volunteers both have a dashboard displaying their
          upcoming events. They can also view past events and access specific
          event details. From an event details page, users can view and take
          related actions such as applications and invitations.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-dashboards.png" width="100%" />
        <p class="caption">
          Left: Educator dashboard. Right: Event details, event applicants.
        </p>
        <h5>Past Iterations</h5>
        <p>
          Early educator dashboard explorations placed applications and
          invitations on the main page. However, in the case of where educators
          have two or more upcoming events, it will be difficult to distinguish
          clearly which event volunteers applied for or were invited to.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-dashboard-iterations.png" width="100%" />
        <p class="caption">Iteration 1</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In the next iteration, we decided to move the applications and
          invitations sections to the event details page to clearly distinguish
          the participants for each event, placing them beneath the details.
          However, all event related information (details, applications,
          invitations) are equally important to educators and not one or the
          other should be hidden beneath the fold. There’s also a chance that
          educators will miss incoming applications if they don’t scroll down.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-event-iterations.png" width="100%" />
        <p class="caption">Iteration 2</p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The final design displays all information at a glance. We moved
          applications and invitations into their own separate tabs with the
          amount of applications received and invitations sent shown. That way,
          users can get high-level information regarding applications and
          invitations without having to scroll, effectively reducing the chance
          of them missing out on important information.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-tabs.png" width="100%" />
        <p class="caption">Final designs</p>
        <br />

        <h4>
          Design Decision:
          <span class="highlight">Actionable Empty States</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
          Considering that browsing opportunities is a new feature, a volunteer
          dashboard’s empty state was an opportunity to introduce the feature
          and encourage users to engage with the platform. The same goes for
          introducing the invitation functionality for educators; the empty
          state informs them on how to fill it with content, by inviting
          volunteers to their event.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-empty-state.png" width="100%" />
        <p class="caption">
          Left: Volunteer dashboard empty state. Right: Educator event
          applications empty state.
        </p>
        <p>
          The text introduces users to the new features and placing a CTA in the
          empty screen guides users’ interactions, increasing engagement. The
          empty state was an opportunity to inform users of all the changes to
          the portal.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4>
          Design Decision:
          <span class="highlight">Informative Cards</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
          To help educators accomplish their task of filling volunteer spots for
          an event, we surface that information for each event on the preview
          card. We show for each event how many spots have already been filled,
          how many applications were received, and how many invitations were
          sent. The user can get all this information right from their dashboard
          without clicking into the event details.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-card.png" width="100%" />

        <br />
        <br />
        <br />
        <h2>Browsing</h2>
        <p>
          This feature replaces the manual matching of events with volunteers
          traditionally done by BEP. For educators, they are able to browse and
          invite volunteers to their events. As for volunteers, they can browse
          upcoming events and let educators know that they’re interested in
          participating.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-browse.png" width="100%" />
        <p class="caption">
          Left: Educator browse volunteers. Right: Volunteer browse
          opportunities.
        </p>
        <h4>Design Decision: <span class="highlight">Filter</span></h4>
        <p>
          To help educators find relevant industry professionals and to help
          volunteers find events of interest, filters are there to guide their
          search. All possible filter parameters are displayed upfront,
          informing the user right away how they can structure their view.
          Selected filter chips are displayed to remind the user that their view
          has been altered.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-filter.png" width="100%" />

        <h5>Past Iteration</h5>
        <p>
          In earlier explorations, filter options open up in a modal. This
          allowed for more of the screen real estate to be dedicated to showing
          the user content. However, users may not be aware of all the possible
          filter parameters or forget that they have filters selected and be
          frustrated by why their view is altered.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-filter-iteration.png" width="100%" />
        <p class="caption">Early explorations</p>
        <p>
          The card layout was also revised for a few reasons. The photo was
          removed as most volunteers indicated that they wouldn’t upload a
          photo. Removing the photo also creates consistency between volunteer
          cards and event cards.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also learned from the users what information should be displayed on
          the card that would be the most useful to them. Knowing how much
          information needed to be presented, a two column layout would decrease
          readability so we opted for a single column layout for scannability.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-filter-final.png" width="100%" />
        <p class="caption">Final browse & filter design.</p>
        <br />

        <h4>Design Decision: <span class="highlight">Infinite Scroll</span></h4>
        <p>
          Between infinite scroll and pagination, we opted for infinite scroll
          to increase user engagement. Since BEP is no longer doing the work of
          finding speakers for an event, we wanted to encourage educators and
          volunteers to find new connections and opportunities themselves. With
          new events being created and more volunteers joining BEP, infinite
          scroll facilitates a smoother browsing and discovering behaviour.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/bep-infinite-scroll.png" width="100%" />
        <br /><br />
        <h4>
          Design Decision:
          <span class="highlight">Disappearing Header</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
          To create more space for browsing, the header is hidden once the user
          starts scrolling down. This allows for one more full volunteer card to
          be shown, increasing the amount of content being shown on screen to
          fully immerse the user. The header comes back once the user starts
          scrolling back up or if they move their cursor to the navigation bar
          so that search and filter is still easily accessible as they help the
          user focus their browsing experience.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <h4>Development Considerations</h4>
        <p>
          Getting to work so closely with a team of developers and working to
          actually build the portal pushed me to really think about all the
          little details such as various states, interactions, and edge cases.
          Not only did those details need to be considered, I also had to
          communicate them to the developers. Design systems and prototypes were
          a huge asset in that.

          Another thing that I learned is that scoping a project isn’t a job
          just for PMs; designers should participate as well. Better and more
          frequent communication with PMs and clients could have caught a lot of
          oversight and resulted in less wasted work. The project was re-scoped
          a few months in and had designers been a part of the conversation
          right from the get go, expectations would have been better managed and
          a lot of time could have been saved.
        </p>
        <h4>User Research</h4>
        <p>
          The last takeaway from this project is that nothing beats talking to
          the users. The NPO was our main point of contact and provided all the
          answers to our questions (in a pinch) but getting access to real users
          is invaluable.

        <h2>Next Steps</h2>
        <p>
          Although this project has shipped and been handed off to the NPO,
          there were a few things that I would have like to have done with more
          time and resources:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add more fun and moments of delight to the UI. We focused on a
            simple and clean UI based on our user demographic but it wouldn’t
            hurt to add a little more visual interest into it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finesse the copy. Copy writing tends to be overlooked but it’s the
            little detail that can really make a difference in UX.
          </li>
          <li>
            Usability testing and design validation. Find out if our designs
            align with users’ current behaviour and habits; if it helps them
            accomplish their tasks.
          </li>
        </ol>
