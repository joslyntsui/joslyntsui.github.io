          (TSP) is a non-organization dedicated to providing educational 
          opportunities in speaking, writing, and leadership to immigrant and 
          refugee women. Their mission is to educate the public on the challenges 
          faced by these women, using their shoes as a metaphor for their journey 
          in their stories. UW Blueprint is a student run organization that 
          builds technology with social impact.
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
            UW Blueprint built a 
            platform for the Shoe Project to showcase their 
            portfolio of 250+ stories to raise awareness and demonstrate the 
            impact of TSP’s work.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            Their original method of displaying the stories through a static 
            webpage didn’t evoke a strong sense of empathy, awareness, or 
            community for immigrant and refugee women. Additionally, TSP has 
            various chapters across Canada but they all feel disconnected from 
            one another. The impact of the organization is viewed chapter by 
            chapter rather than as a whole. This makes it difficult for TSP to 
            showcase the impact of their work and increase their marketing and 
            sponsorship efforts. 
        </p>
        <p class="callout">
            How might we tie all the work done by each TSP chapter across Canada 
            together and display it holistically to better showcase the impact 
            of the organization and build a stronger sense of community for 
            immigrant & refugee women?  
        </p>
        <br />

        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p class="callout">
            An interactive visualization of stories written by immigrant women 
            that can be maintained and updated by TSP.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>Arriving at the Solution</h3>
        <h2>User Research Findings</h2>
        <p>
            Working closely with the PM and NPO, we realized that there would be 
            two parts to the product for two different users: 
            <ol> 
                <li>The public facing portion of the platform where general users 
                    are coming to read the stories 
                </li>
                <li>The TSP admin facing portion where TSP can manage the stories 
                    that are displayed to the public
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>Through research and interviews with users and stakeholders, we 
            gathered some considerations to keep in mind. 
        </p>
  
        <p><b>Key findings — General user reading stories:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Based on the analytics of TSP’s website, many users are viewing on 
            mobile
          </li>
          <li>
            Most users won’t be interesting in all the stories, just the ones 
            that are relevant and/or relatable to them 
          </li>
          <li>
            Users like to know a bit more about a story before committing to read 
            it 
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>Key findings — TSP admin managing stories: </b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            TSP is continuously working with women to write more stories; new 
            stories are being added every few weeks
          </li>
          <li>
            To date, there are more than 250+ stories written across multiple 
            TSP chapters. 
          </li>
          <li>
            TSP would like to highlight certain stories, sometimes according to 
            a theme (ie. during Refugee Awareness Month, stories from Refugees 
            women would be spotlit) 
          </li>
          <li>
            TSP plans on swapping out the stories displayed on a monthly basis
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        <p>
            We were fortunate to have worked with an extremely responsive and 
            helpful client, enabling us to have constant access to users 
            (especially when the client was also our user). Due to that 
            relationship, we got to test and validate designs early and often. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tsp-process.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">The process for this project</p>
        <p>We followed a “hot potato” process when handing off designs for 
            development. Instead of handing off designs all at the end, we had 
            various touchpoints with engineers to avoid a design bottleneck and 
            ensure technical feasibility. 
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>Feature Breakdown & Decisions</h3>
        <h2>Story Discover [Story Showcase]</h2>
        <p>
            This is the general public facing portion of the platform where 
            anyone can come to read the stories. The platform that UW Blueprint 
            built to host stories links directly from TSP’s main website. 
        </p>
        <h4>
          Design Decision:
          <span class="highlight">Map</span>
        </h4>
        <p>
            When we were first presented with TSP’s problem, we wanted to find a 
            way to display the stories that builds a sense of community for the 
            immigrant and refugee women of Canada. Each pin on the map represents 
            a story and is placed in the Canadian city that the woman immigrated 
            to. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tsp-map.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Map concept on mweb and web</p>
        <p>Additionally, the map sorts the stories into the Canadian cities that 
            the women immigrated to. During user interviews, users noted that 
            they’re more interested in the stories of women from their community. 
            In map format, users can easily find the stories that are relevant to 
            them by moving the map to their city of interest. 
        </p>
        <p>At first, we thought of a simple static page where stories can be read, 
            such as Medium. Or, something a little more interesting such as a blog 
            format like Tumblr. However, we realized that those formats of 
            browsing the stories do little to build empathy or community. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tsp-concepts.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Left: Article concept. Right: Blog concept.</p>
        <p>To validate our decisions, we met with our stakeholders as well as 
            members of the TSP community and presented the three concepts to them. 
            Majority of surveyed participants felt that it was much more impactful 
            to see the clusters of pins scattered across the map of Canada. It 
            successfully builds empathy by visually illustrating the community of 
            women. Stakeholders said that it was powerful to see just how many of 
            these immigrant and refugee women walk among us. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>
            Design Decision:
            <span class="highlight">Redirect Pin</span>
        </h4>
        <p>Users can zoom in and out on the map and drag the map around to 
            navigate. As users zoom in, the pins will expand to show more pins. 
            In case users wind up on a part of the map where there aren’t any 
            stories, a redirect pin that points users to the nearest city with 
            stories will appear. Clicking on the redirect pin will reposition 
            users to where there are stories. 
        </p>
        <video class="center-img" autoplay loop muted>
            <source src="Assets/tsp-redirect.mov" type="video/mp4" />
        </video>
        <p class="caption">Redirct pin brings users to the nearest cluster of 
            stories
        </p>
        <p>This feature was implemented to mitigate any frustrations if users 
            got “lost”. Given that stories get swapped out regularly and Canada 
            is a big country, there’s a chance that users may wind up somewhere 
            without stories by accident. 
        </p>
        <br> 

        <h2>Filter [Story Showcase]</h2>
        <p>Users can filter stories by which country the story originates from 
            (the country that the woman left). Since readers indicated during 
            user interviews that they may be more interested in stories from 
            specific countries, this allows them to easily find those stories.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h4>
            Design Decision:
            <span class="highlight">Search Select</span>
        </h4>
        <p>A search select interaction was implemented for two use cases: 
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>If a user is looking for a specific country, they can just start 
                typing the name of the country in without having to scroll 
                through the list. 
            </li>
            <li>Since TSP regularly switches out which stories are showcased, a 
                story from any given country may be there one week and gone the 
                next. By showing users a list of which countries the current 
                stories originated from, users can also browse through to see 
                if any of them pique their interest.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <video class="center-img" autoplay loop muted>
            <source src="Assets/tsp-search-select.mov" type="video/mp4" />
          </video>
        <p class="caption">Search select interaction</p>
        <br> 
        <h5>Past Iterations</h5>
        <p>On mobile, we explored having all countries visible at the top 
            (exploration A) but then realized that horizontal scrolling is an 
            unnatural motion on mobile and that there could be many different 
            countries, making it hard to find a specific one. In exploration B, 
            we had filter hidden in L2 before we realized that we had more screen 
            real estate that could be better utilized. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tsp-mweb-filter-explorations.png" width="100%">
        <p class="caption">Left: Exploration A (chips). Right: Exploration B
            (hidden in L2).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>On desktop, we explored different concepts given that we had more 
            screen real estate on desktop. Exploration A was quickly ruled out 
            because we didn’t have content to populate the left rail. We also 
            tried grouping the countries to lessen cognitive load in exploration 
            B but there was no way to know for certain what stories from which 
            countries would be displayed, resulting in potentially some categories 
            being empty. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tsp-web-filter-explorations.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Left: Exploration A (left rail). Right: Exploration B 
            (categories)
        </p>
        <br> 

        <h4>
            Design Decision:
            <span class="highlight">Chips & Banners</span>
        </h4>
        <p>Chips are used to keep users informed of their filter selections. Users 
            can easily remove one filter at a time or clear all filters. Banners 
            indicating each story’s origin appear above each pin when two or more 
            filters are selected to help users separate out which story comes from 
            which country.
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tsp-chips-banners.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Close up of filter + banners</p>
        <p>The banners only appear if the users are zoomed in enough to see each 
            individual pin. Each time a new filter criterion is selected, the map 
            will be zoomed out fully (to see the entire country) so that users can 
            see where pins remain after the filter is applied. 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2>Reading stories [Story Showcase]</h2>
        <p>As the main purpose of this website, users can read the stories written 
            by immigrant and refugee women. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>
            Design Decision:
            <span class="highlight">Preview Story</span>
        </h4>
        <p>Before committing to reading a story, users can preview what the story is 
            about. A snippet or synopsis of the story is shown to hook in a reader 
            along with some additional story details and a clear CTA to encourage 
            users to read the full story. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tsp-preview.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Story preview on mweb and web</p>
        <br> 

        <h5>Past Iterations</h5>
        <p>We tested various card layouts and interactions. To close out of the 
            preview in the first iteration of the preview card, users could swipe 
            down on mobile and click outside the card on desktop. However, during 
            usability testing, users weren’t confident on how to exit out of the 
            preview, especially on mobile, and it wasn’t clear to them that 
            clicking the preview card would open the full story. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tsp-preview-explorations.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Preview card explorations</p>
        <p>To mitigate those usability problems, we added clear affordance to 
            close the preview and to read the full story on top of the initial 
            interactions. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tsp-preview-card.png" width="100%">

        <h4>
            Design Decision:
            <span class="highlight">Drawer</span>
        </h4>
        <p>The full story slides in from the right (on desktop) for three reasons: 
            <ol>
                <li>Accessibility: the text spans no more than 8 columns, making it 
                    more legible since the eye has a shorter distance to travel 
                    from the end of one line to the beginning of the next. 
                </li>
                <li>Users can get back to the map quickly and easily to continue 
                    exploring stories 
                </li>
                <li>It matches the TSP brand and website. Given that the platform 
                    that UW Blueprint built links from TSP’s main website, we wanted 
                    to ensure that our product looks and feels like TSP.

        </h4>
        <p>At the bottom of each story, similar stories (ie. other stories from the 
            same author, stories from the same country/region, etc.) will be 
            recommended to the user. This is to encourage users to continue to read 
            more stories, especially if they enjoyed the story they just read.

            of all the stories that have been uploaded to the portal. TSP would use 
            this view to see what stories are in their database that they can 
            showcase. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tsp-all-stories.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">All stories</p>
        <p>The second is a view of all the stories that are toggled to be visible on 
            the map. This view helps confirm to TSP which stories will be showcased 
            if they were to publish changes at that moment. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tsp-visible-stories.png" class="center-img">
        <p class="caption">Visible stories</p>
        <p>The final view is a log of what changes were made since the last time 
            changes were published. It shows the user which stories were removed from 
            the showcase and which ones were added. This reassures TSP that all the 
            changes were intentional and helps them keep track of all the changes 
            that were made.

        <h4>
            Design Decision:
            <span class="highlight">Search, Filter, Sort</span>
        </h4>
        <p>To date, TSP has more than 250+ stories written across multiple TSP 
            chapters. It’s hard for TSP personnel to keep track of all the stories 
            so they need an easy and intuitive way to parse through all the stories.
        </p>
        <p>If TSP is looking for a specific story, they can search for it by story 
            title, author name, date, Canadian city, or country of origin. 
        </p>
        <video class="center-img" autoplay loop muted>

          </video>
        <p class="caption">Searching stories</p>
        <p>TSP can also tag stories by theme (ie. refugee, inspirational, 
            educational, etc.) and filter by those tags. 
        </p>
        <video class="center-img" autoplay loop muted>

          </video>
        <p class="caption">Filtering stories by tags</p>
        <p>TSP can also sort all 250+ stories by multiple fields and determine 
            in what order the sort will be applied (ie. by year, and within each 
            year, by author alphabetically, etc.) 
        </p>
        <video class="center-img" autoplay loop muted>

          </video>
        <p class="caption">Sorting 250+ stories</p>
        <p>Users can also easily rearrange the order in which sort is applied by 
            dragging the fields around. They even have the option to sort and filter 
            each view independently of the others.

        <h5>Past Iterations</h5>
        <p>In the first iteration, we followed a pattern used by spreadsheet 
            software where clicking on a column header would apply sort. However, 
            during usability testing, users couldn’t figure out how to sort the 
            stories because there was no clear affordance. 
        </p>
        <img src="Assets/tsp-sort-iteration-1.png" width="100%">
        <p class="caption">Sort iteration 1</p>
        <p>In the second iteration, we added a chevron as an affordance. While 
            users were able to figure out how to sort the stories during usability 
            testing, we realized that there wasn’t a clear way to indicate to users 
            that a sort had been applied nor in what order fields were being sorted 
            by. 
        </p>

        <p class="caption">Sort iteration 2</p>
        <p>The final iteration is intuitive in how to apply sort as well as 
            understanding and re-arranging the order in which sort is being applied. 
            Users are even able to reverse sort.

        <h4>
            Design Decision:
            <span class="highlight">Multi-Select</span>
        </h4>
        <p>TSP has 30-50 stories displayed at a time and they usually switch out 
            all the stories at once. It would be tedious to manually click to hide 
            50 stories individually so we implemented a feature to target either 
            just visible stories, hidden stories, or all stories. That way, users 
            can select all visible stories at once and hide them with one click.

        <h4>
            Design Decision:
            <span class="highlight">Feedback</span>
        </h4>
        <p>To reassure users that an action did happen, feedback is always offered.
        </p>
        <video class="center-img" autoplay loop muted>

        <p class="caption">Snackbar for feedback, with option to undo action</p>
        <p>In case of errors, users are given the chance to correct them easily 
            with an “undo” button that accompanies the feedback.

        <h2>Upload story [TSP Admin]</h2>
        <p>TSP is still hosting writing workshops to continuously help women 
            write stories. These newly written stories get uploaded to the 
            database so that they can be showcased. Each woman is paired with a 
            TSP writing mentor who then uploads the story by filling out a form 
            on the dashboard with the story’s details after the story is finished.

            Design Decision:
            <span class="highlight">Tag Creation</span>
        </h4>
        <p>Tagging stories helps TSP keep track of each stories moral and/or theme. 
            TSP can select from a list of existing tags or create a new one simply 
            by typing and hitting enter.

        <br>

        <h5>Past Iterations</h5>
        <p>Another concept that we explored was having a clear CTA to create a new tag.

        <p class="caption">Tag creation interaction iteration 1</p>
        <p>During A/B testing, we found that the majority of users preferred to just 
            type to create as it saves them one less click. They felt it was intuitive 
            and usable, especially with the helper text.

            <span class="highlight">Warning for Destructive Actions</span>
          </h4>
        <p>To delete a tag, users can hover over it and use the kebab to access 
            advanced actions. Before deleting the tag, a modal pops up asking the user 
            to confirm their actions and informs them of the consequence of the 
            destructive action by telling them how many stories will be affected.

        <h2>Design System</h2>
        <p>Working so closely with engineers pushed me to think of all the little 
            details, from edge cases to states to interaction design. A design system 
            really helped as a tool of communication and source of truth.

        <p>This project launched April 2021 and the Shoe Project has been using it to 
            showcase the impact of their work ever since. I’m super proud of the work 
            that the team put into this; some of my favourite and proudest moments 
            were from this team. 
        </p>
        <br> 

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <h4>Test early and test often</h4>
        <p>
            We were fortunate to have been able to meet with users every week (if 
            necessary) so we were able to test our designs and validate designs early 
            on in the design process. Once we had an idea, we’d whip up a scrappy (but 
            not crappy) wireframe and test it with users. Every design and decision 
            that we moved into high-fidelity was validated and we never had to waste 
            any time or work. Because of this, we were also able to always stay at 
            least 1-2 sprints ahead of development.
        </p>
        <h4>How to mentor</h4>
        <p>
            For this project, I mentored and worked with a junior designer. This 
            partnership really tested my communication skills and knowledge of best 
            design practices. It’s one thing to know and apply practices, it’s 
            another to explain it to someone else. I also learned how to adjust my 
            feedback style for different audiences and how to delegate design work. 
            It really gave me a huge sense of fulfillment and pride to watch them 
            learn and grow as a designer, knowing that I played a part in their 
            growth.
        </p>
        <h4>Engineers make me a better designer</h4>
        <p>
            Every time I work with engineers, they never fail to catch the little 
            details that I missed, such as edge cases, different states, and 
            interactions. They elevate our design system to be more than just a 
            library of components to make designing faster; it becomes a tool of 
            communication. Engineers constantly challenge me by asking “but what 
            about when [x] happens”. By working with engineers, I always come out a 
            better interaction designer.
        </p>
        <h4>Content design is underrated</h4>
        <p>This project helped me realize just how big of a difference copy makes 
            in user experience. I found myself spending a lot of time testing out 
            different words to use in my designs. There were also some challenges 
            regarding designing around content that isn’t constant. For example, 
            we had to ensure that our designs were flexible enough to accommodate 
            short names and long names. After this project, I have a newfound 
            appreciation for content strategists.
