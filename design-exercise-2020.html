      <h2>Discovering the problem</h2>
      <p>
        I interviewed 3 first years, 2 mentees, 2 upper years, and 3 mentors
        (past orientation leaders) to find out more about their experiences and
        what they look for in a mentor-mentee relationship.
      </p>
      <h4>First year insights ("new" students)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Feeling lost in general</li>
        <li>Often too shy and don’t know how to reach out</li>
        <li>Struggle to meet the “right” mentor</li>
        <li>Various fields for mentorship</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        “I don’t want to annoy or bother upper years”<br />“I just don’t know
        what’s going on”
      </p>
      <h4>Mentee insights (second year +)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Met their mentors at community events (ex. mixers, clubs, conferences,
          hackathons, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>Grapevine: being introduced from someone else</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“Mentorship is a lot like dating”</p>
      <h4>Upper year insights ("experienced" students)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Won’t actively be looking to mentor someone</li>
        <li>Wouldn’t mind helping/mentoring if reached out to</li>
        <li>More “passive”</li>
      </ul>
      <p>“If someone came up to me and ask for advice, I wouldn’t mind”</p>
      <h4>Mentor insights (orientation leaders, peer leaders, etc.)</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Actively encourage mentees to connect with them</li>
        <li>
          Want to provide the mentees with the best advice possible – if they
          can’t help them with something, they’ll try to connect them with
          someone who can (grapevine)
        </li>
        <li>Sometimes are too busy to mentor but still want to help</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        “I might not be able to help them but I usually know someone else who
        can”
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Core Problems</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Meeting the right people <br />
          This can be further broken down into:
          <ol>
            <li>
              Meeting people who have similar experiences (ex. Program, career,
              interests, campus living)
            </li>
            <li>Meeting all potential mentors</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Bridging gaps between mentor and mentees</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These problems are intertwined, making them complex to solve
        individually.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p>
        Help mentor and mentees <b>discover</b> each other and <b>encourage</b>>
        experienced students to <b>connect</b> with new students.
      </p>
      <p>Goals:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Make it easy for mentors and mentees to learn about each other</li>
        <li>Lower barriers to contact</li>
        <li>Involve other experienced students who aren’t active mentors</li>
      </ol>
      <br />
      <h2>User flows</h2>
      <p>
        I used user flows to get a clearer picture as to what the experience
        might look like for both mentees and mentors. It’s a very high-level
        view just to keep me organized to visualize the interactions between
        mentors and mentees.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/exercise-flow.png" width="100%" />
      <p>
        I then moved to Sketch to further flush out the flows through wireframes
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/exercise-flow-wires.png" width="100%" />
      <br />
      <h2>Solving the problem</h2>
      <p>
        I chose to design for web because people
        <a
          href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/25/majority-of-u-s-consumers-still-download-zero-apps-per-month-says-comscore/"
          class="highlight swipe-up"
          >don't like</a
        >
        to download apps. A URL is a lower barrier to entry than downloading an
        app, encouraging more students to join the platform. It can be accessed
        from any device with an internet connection. There would also be a
        mobile app format to improve the experience on mobile, however it can
        also be accessed via web on mobile.
      </p>
      <h4>Profile creation</h4>
      <p>
        The purpose of the mentee and mentor profiles is to address goal #1,
        ease of discoverability. Mentees would input some basic information such
        as program, career goals, interests, etc. and in what areas they want
        mentorship in. Mentors would input the same sort of basic information
        and their experiences and areas of expertise. Mentors and mentees can
        then browse through and see if there are any potential for meaningful
        mentorships.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/exercise-profile-creation.png" width="100%" />
      <p class="caption">
        Since students are logging in with their student IDs, some fields of the
        their profile can be pre-populated (ex. name, program, email, etc.) to
        lessen the workload on the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        The profile creation also serves as a questionnaire that is then used to
        personalize the dashboard. Some parts of the profile creation won’t be
        shown publicly and are used to match mentors to mentees and vice versa.
        For example, if a mentee states that they are more on the shy side, then
        their dashboard would display mentors who are more on the proactive
        side. That way, each mentee and mentor’s dashboard will be customized
        for the most optimal match. Mentees will be able to scroll through all
        available mentors on the platform and the mentors will be ranked from
        best match to least (and vice versa).
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/exercise-preference.png" width="100%" />
      <h4>Preferred method of contact</h4>
      <p>
        Students have favourite messaging platforms and heavily prefer them as
        they use them daily. Most conversations that occur outside of those
        platforms will eventually get moved onto them in the end (findings from
        a previous survey). To lower the barrier to contact and ensure that the
        mentor-mentee relationship is sustained long-term (goal #2), the
        platform itself won’t serve as a messaging app rather it will display
        the preferred method of contact. If a mentee finds a mentor that they
        want to reach out to, they will send a mentorship request and if the
        mentor accepts it, then their contact information will be displayed (and
        vice versa) for privacy reasons. The mentorship request will also serve
        as a “notification” for the user to keep an eye out for a message on
        those platforms.
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/exercise-preferred-contact.png" width="100%" />
      <h4>Mentor's network</h4>
      <p>
        As experienced students have been on campus longer, they are likely to
        have an established network of friends who also have experience. In
        addition to their profile, mentors will also have a network section
        where they can list areas where they may not personally be able to help
        but know people who can. As many experienced students noted, they are
        more than happy to help if someone reached out to them though they may
        not actively seek out mentees. This way, the “active” mentors can act as
        a grapevine and a point of connection between mentees and “passive”
        mentors to keep other experienced students involved (goal #3).
      </p>
      <img src="Assets/exercise-network.png" width="100%" />
      <h2>Additional features</h2>
      <h4>Update/edit profile</h4>
      <p>
        This platform has the potential to be more than just connecting new
        students to experienced students; even “experienced” students could
        still want to receive mentorship in certain areas. As students journey
        through university, their needs and experiences will change and so their
        profile should reflect that.
      </p>
      <h4>Status</h4>
      <p>
        To accommodate students’ ever changing, busy schedules and needs, both
        mentees and mentors can change their status which will be used to
        calibrate their dashboard.
        <br />
        Mentees: as new students progress through their first year, the urgency
        of their need for mentorship in different areas will change.
        <br />
        Mentors: the status is directly reflective of their availability as
        certain times of the year will be busier than others.
      </p>
      <h2>High fidelity</h2>
      <img src="Assets/exercise-hi-fi-dashboard.jpg" width="100%" />
      <br />
      <img src="Assets/exercise-hi-fi-profile.jpg" width="100%" />
      <h2>Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        Interviewing 10 users is not representative of the entire student
        demographic but due to time and resource constraints, it will suffice
        for the purposes of this exercise.
      </p>
      <p>
        An aspect that could be explored further is transitioning from a mentee
        to a mentor or even looking for mentorship in one area but being a
        mentor in another.
      </p>
      <p>
        A feature that I considered but didn’t fully flush out is having a forum
        where mentees can post more specific requests. The platform is currently
        doing it’s matching on very general criteria, though there may be topics
        that are a little more specific that mentees may want guidance on (ex.
        Trying to complete a double degree, taking a gap year, etc). Mentors can
        then browse through those requests and offer public advice (for any of
        those that may have a similar question) or reach out to the mentee as
        per usual. This feature was included in the user flow but greyed out. If
        I had more time, I would have explored it further.
      </p>
      <br />
      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I spent a little too much time in the first diamond (discovering and
        ideating) and didn’t leave enough time for the second diamond
        (developing and delivering). I underestimated how much time doing the
        high-fidelity mockups would take and I should have allocated my time
        better.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I think that I was able to gather some valuable insights and
        ideate on features that could really help mentors and mentees discover
        and connect, and encourage experienced students to get involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I had more time, I would definitely flush out the visual designs a
        lot more, prototype some interactions, and maybe even explore beyond
        just connecting new students to experienced students and making the
        platform a place that could be used by all students to share their
        experiences and to learn from one another.
